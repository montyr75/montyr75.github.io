 * Dispatches events to listeners using the Dart [Stream] API. The [EventBus] 
 * enables decoupled applications. It allows objects to interact without
 * requiring to explicitly define listeners and keeping track of them.
 * 
 * Usually there is just one [EventBus] per application, but more than one 
 * may be set up to group a specific set of events.
 * 
 * Not all events should be broadcasted through the [EventBus] but only those of
 * general interest.
 * 
 * **Note:** Make sure that listeners on the stream handle the same type <T> as 
 * the generic type argument of [EventType]. Currently, this can't be expressed in 
 * Dart - see [Issue 254](https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/detail?id=254)
